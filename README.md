Hey there! I'm @brlim.

I'm interested in all aspects of software development but I'm currently focused specifically on .NET and C#!
I'm currently learning about all of the great new features and changes coming out with .NET 6 as well as
all of the news coming out for software development in general. There's so many great languages and ways
to solve different issues in creative ways, and we can all become better developers by helping each other out.
A rising tide lifts all boats. Thanks for checking out my profile!
